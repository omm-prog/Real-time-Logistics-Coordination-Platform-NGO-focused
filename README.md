# Smart Waste & Food Management System

A comprehensive web platform that connects food donors with NGOs to reduce food waste and support communities in need.

## Overview

The Smart Waste & Food Management System bridges the gap between surplus food and those who need it most. By leveraging intelligent location-based matching and automated notifications, this web platform ensures that excess food reaches NGOs and charitable organizations before it goes to waste.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Matching System
- **Automated NGO Notifications**: Instant alerts sent to nearby NGOs when food donations become available
- **Location-Based Tracking**: Smart matching using Google Maps API to connect donors with the closest NGOs
- **Dynamic Radius Expansion**: Progressive search radius expansion (2km → 5km → 10km → 200km) to maximize donation reach

### Real-Time Coordination
- Seamless communication between donors and NGOs
- Real-time status updates on donation availability and claims
- Efficient pickup coordination and logistics support

### Impact Tracking
- Monitor food waste reduction metrics
- Track successful donations and their reach
- Generate reports on community impact

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Web Application)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
- **Maps & Location**: Google Maps API
- **Real-time Updates**: Firebase Cloud Messaging

## Why This Matters

**Environmental Impact**: Significantly reduces food waste by ensuring surplus food reaches those in need rather than landfills.

**Social Impact**: Supports NGOs and charitable organizations in their mission to feed communities and reduce hunger.

**Efficiency**: Automates the traditionally manual process of food donation coordination, making it faster and more reliable.

**Scalability**: Designed to expand across multiple cities and regions, maximizing impact potential.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Firebase account
- Google Maps API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omm-prog/Food-Waste-Management.git
   cd Food-Waste-Management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Firestore Database and Authentication
   - Copy your Firebase configuration
   - Update `firebaseConfig.js` with your credentials

4. **Configure Google Maps API**
   - Obtain a Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console
   - Add the API key to your environment variables

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## How It Works

### For Food Donors

1. **Registration**: Create an account and verify your identity
2. **Post Donation**: Add details about surplus food (type, quantity, location, expiration)
3. **Automatic Matching**: System notifies nearby NGOs based on location and food type
4. **Coordination**: Communicate with interested NGOs and arrange pickup
5. **Confirmation**: Mark donation as complete once food is collected

### For NGOs

1. **Organization Setup**: Register your NGO with verification documents
2. **Receive Notifications**: Get instant alerts about food donations in your area
3. **Claim Donations**: Review and claim suitable donations based on your capacity
4. **Coordinate Pickup**: Arrange collection logistics with donors
5. **Report Impact**: Document the beneficiaries reached through the donation

### Smart Radius Expansion

When a food donation is posted, the system follows this intelligent matching process:

- **Initial Search**: Look for NGOs within 2km radius
- **First Expansion**: If no response within set timeframe, expand to 5km
- **Second Expansion**: Further expand to 10km if needed
- **Maximum Reach**: Final expansion up to 200km to ensure no food goes to waste
