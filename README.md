## 📋 Overview

The Smart Waste & Food Management System bridges the gap between surplus food and those who need it most. By leveraging intelligent location-based matching and automated notifications, this web platform ensures that excess food reaches NGOs and charitable organizations before it goes to waste.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Intelligent Matching System
- **🔔 Automated NGO Notifications**: Instant alerts sent to nearby NGOs when food donations become available
- **📍 Location-Based Tracking**: Smart matching using Google Maps API to connect donors with the closest NGOs
- **📡 Dynamic Radius Expansion**: Progressive search radius expansion (2km → 5km → 10km → 200km) to maximize donation reach

### ⚡ Real-Time Coordination
- 💬 Seamless communication between donors and NGOs
- 🔄 Real-time status updates on donation availability and claims
- 🚚 Efficient pickup coordination and logistics support

### 📊 Impact Tracking
- 📈 Monitor food waste reduction metrics
- ✅ Track successful donations and their reach
- 📄 Generate reports on community impact

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **💻 Frontend**: React (Web Application)
- **🔥 Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
- **🗺️ Maps & Location**: Google Maps API
- **📱 Real-time Updates**: Firebase Cloud Messaging

## 🎯 Why This Matters

**🌱 Environmental Impact**: Significantly reduces food waste by ensuring surplus food reaches those in need rather than landfills.

**🤝 Social Impact**: Supports NGOs and charitable organizations in their mission to feed communities and reduce hunger.

**⚡ Efficiency**: Automates the traditionally manual process of food donation coordination, making it faster and more reliable.

**📈 Scalability**: Designed to expand across multiple cities and regions, maximizing impact potential.

## 🔄 How It Works

### 👨‍💼 For Food Donors

1. **📝 Registration**: Create an account and verify your identity
2. **🍎 Post Donation**: Add details about surplus food (type, quantity, location, expiration)
3. **🎯 Automatic Matching**: System notifies nearby NGOs based on location and food type
4. **💬 Coordination**: Communicate with interested NGOs and arrange pickup
5. **✅ Confirmation**: Mark donation as complete once food is collected

### 🏢 For NGOs

1. **🏛️ Organization Setup**: Register your NGO with verification documents
2. **🔔 Receive Notifications**: Get instant alerts about food donations in your area
3. **✋ Claim Donations**: Review and claim suitable donations based on your capacity
4. **🚚 Coordinate Pickup**: Arrange collection logistics with donors
5. **📋 Report Impact**: Document the beneficiaries reached through the donation

### 🎯 Smart Radius Expansion

When a food donation is posted, the system follows this intelligent matching process:

- **🎯 Initial Search**: Look for NGOs within 2km radius
- **📍 First Expansion**: If no response within set timeframe, expand to 5km
- **🔍 Second Expansion**: Further expand to 10km if needed
- **🌐 Maximum Reach**: Final expansion up to 200km to ensure no food goes to waste
